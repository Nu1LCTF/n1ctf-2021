In this challenge, your need to upload alphanumeric shellcode to solve some algorithm challenges.

The alphanumeric shellcode encoder is written by myself. And to reach the limit of upload size. I use a simple XOR shellcode encoder to reduce the bytes which alphanumeric shellcode encoder need to convert

The first two challenge is easy and does not need to explain. The third challenge is about sequence alignment and should use some algorithm like Smith-Waterman to solve
